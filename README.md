# Genesis ROS Bridge (gs_ros) 🤖
![alt text](genesis_teaser.png)
`gs_ros` is a ROS 2 package designed to bridge the gap between the powerful [Genesis](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis.git) simulator and the ROS 2 ecosystem. Genesis is a next-generation physics platform for Robotics and Embodied AI, offering:

1. A universal physics engine built from the ground up for a wide range of materials.
2. A lightweight, ultra-fast, and user-friendly robotics simulation platform.
3. A powerful and fast photo-realistic rendering system.
4. A generative data engine that can create multi-modal data from natural language prompts.

This project provides the essential tools to kickstart your robotics development and simulation within ROS 2 using Genesis. Using this package is very simple, the main code is 5 lines long

## ✨ Key Features

`gs_ros` is a lightweight, pure Python package that simplifies the integration of Genesis and ROS 2.

- **Standard Simulation Interfaces**: Implements the [simulation_interfaces](https://index.ros.org/r/simulation_interfaces/#humble) standard through the `gs_simulation_interfaces` package.
- **ROS 2 Control Integration**: Leverages `topic_based_ros2_control` from PickNikRobotics for seamless compatibility with the `ros2_control` framework.
- **Simulator Services**: Exposes core simulator functionalities (like spawning robots, defining sensors, pausing, resetting, domain randomisation, inverse kinematics, forward kinematics, path planning) through custom ROS 2 services defined in the `gs_ros_interfaces` package.
- **Comprehensive Sensor Suite**: Provides a variety of simulated sensors, publishing data on standard ROS 2 topics.

## 🎮 Supported Sensors

`gs_ros` provides out-of-the-box support for several common robotics sensors:

- 📷 **Camera**: Publishes RGB, depth, semantic segmentation, and surface normal images.
- 📸 **RGBD Camera**: A convenient wrapper for synchronized RGB and depth image publishing.
- 🛰️ **IMU**: Simulates an Inertial Measurement Unit.
- 📏 **Sectional Lidar**: A ray based lidar covering a section of the space(analogus to a depth camera).
- 🌐 **3D Lidar**: A ray based 360 degree 3D Lidar.
- 📡 **LaserScan**: A 360 degree laser-scan with one vertical channel, commonly used in robotics.
- 💥 **Contact Force Sensor**: A tactile sensor to measure the force experienced by a specified link.
- 💥 **Contact Sensor**: A binary tactile sensor to check if an entity is in contact with any other entity.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **ROS 2**: This package is developed for ROS 2. Ensure you have a working installation (e.g., Humble, Iron).
2. **Genesis Simulator**: Install Genesis by following the instructions in the official [Genesis repository](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis.git).
    > **Note**: `gs_ros` was tested with Genesis `v0.3.10`. Newer versions may have compatibility issues. Please report any problems you encounter!

### Steps

1. **Downgrade NumPy**
    The default NumPy version installed with Genesis may not be compatible with ROS 2. Downgrade to a compatible version(optional):
    ```bash
    pip install numpy==1.26.4
    ```

2. **Clone the Repository**
    Navigate to your Colcon workspace's `src` directory and clone this repository.
    ```bash
    # Example for a workspace in ~/ros2_ws
    cd ~/ros2_ws/src
    git clone https://github.com/vybhav-ibr/genesis_ros.git .
    ```

3. **Update sub modules**
    Update submodules and checkout to the appropriate branch
    ```bash
    git submodule update --remote
    cd simulation_interfaces
    git fetch origin
    git checkout $ROS_DISTRO
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies**
    Let `rosdep` handle the required dependencies.
    ```bash
    cd ~/ros2_ws
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
    ```

5. **Build and Source the Workspace**
    Build the package using `colcon`.
    ```bash
    cd ~/ros2_ws
    colcon build
    ```
    > **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter an `ImportError: No module named 'em'`, it might be due to a conflict with a Python virtual environment. Deactivate any active virtual environment run the `colcon clean workspace` command and try building with the `--merge-install` flag:
    > `colcon build --merge-install`

    After a successful build, source your workspace's setup file:
    ```bash
    source install/setup.bash
    ```

## 🧪 Example Usage

1. **Configure Asset Paths**
    Before launching, you must update the `parent_config.yaml` file to point to the correct paths for your local assets, and use the necessary sensors.

2. **Start the genesis Simulator and the gs_ros bridge**

    ```bash
    python test_import.py
    ```

3. **Launch the Ackermann Drive Demo**
    Run the provided demo from the `gs_ros2_control_demos` package to see a wheeled robot in action.

    ```bash
    ros2 launch gs_ros2_control_demos ackermann_drive_example.launch.py
    ```

## 📝 Known Issues & Limitations

-   **Genesis Version**: Genesis is under active development. Using the latest version from their `main` branch will likely cause issues. Sticking to a tagged release like `v0.3.10` is recommended. but any version after `v0.3.10` should be mostly compatible
-   **Parallel Environments**: Support for parallelized simulation environments is not yet implemented but may be added in the future.
-   **Sensor Models**: Currently, no advanced sensor noise or distortion models are included. This is planned for a future release.
-   **topic_based_ros2_control**: This external package used in gs_ros is set to be deprecated shortly, modifying the ros2_control tag in the gs_ros2_control_demos is advised. The suggested alternative of [topic_based_ros2_control](https://github.com/PickNikRobotics/topic_based_ros2_control) is [topic_based_hardware_interfaces](https://github.com/ros-controls/topic_based_hardware_interfaces). gs_ros will be migrated to use the suggested alternative in a future release
